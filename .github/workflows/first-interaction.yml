          Hi!
          
          
          Thank you for opening your first issue. Elementary, we appreciate all feedback that help us to keep improving this plugin.
          
          
          As this is a [community project](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/scan-gradle-plugin#the-fine-print) we can't commit to official due dates for reviews and developing, but we're definitely committed to deliver services, integrations and plugins of quality.
          
          
          So please be patiente while we're able to review issues and get back to you.
          
          
          
          Regards,
